## Web-Based-Movie-Rating-Prediction-System

The Movie Rating Prediction System is a web-based platform designed to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques. It allows users to input various movie details and obtain accurate predictions regarding the movie's rating.

## Project Description

The Web-Based Movie Rating Prediction System is a comprehensive platform designed to accurately forecast movie ratings using advanced machine learning algorithms. Leveraging factors such as duration, release year, and viewer votes, this system employs Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development. Integrated with Django for web development, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend implementation, the project offers a user-friendly interface for users to input movie details and receive precise rating predictions, facilitating informed decision-making for both viewers and filmmakers alike.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface:** The frontend interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Accurate predictions:** The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions based on inputted movie details.
- **Responsive design:** The application is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Model Selection

The best models for predicting movie ratings are selected based on accuracy. The following models are evaluated:

1. **RandomForestRegressor:** Ensemble learning technique known for its robustness and accuracy.
2. **LinearRegression:** Classic regression algorithm used for predicting continuous variables.
3. **KNeighborsRegressor:** Regression algorithm based on similarity to neighboring data points.
